# SBTs on Solana

This is an API for protocols to interact with in order to mint SBTs for their users
an SBT can be derived as a PDA from user pubkey

have to think about how to structure this

should the user's wallet be the holder of the SBT? that makes the most sense 
otherwise, other DAOs would have to query my DAO to get the data...?

xHashTag on EVM chains uses SBTs to verify reputation / skills / certifications
I can do something similar as a freelance site, verifying certain skills
